# DEV_STATUS — Elemental TCG: Implementation State

> Last updated: 2026-07-01 (monetization plan alignment; no monetization features implemented)

## Planned — Monetization and Vending Machine revamp

`PLAN_MONETIZATION.md` is the source of truth for the next acquisition/monetization
work. It is **planning-only**: the current runtime still has the flat Vending
Machine panel, static 70/25/5 rolling without duplicate-aware candidate exclusion,
no Item Mall, no Developer Product receipt handler, and no persistent currency bar.

The planned successor adds live server-computed **per-card-draw** odds, same-rarity
duplicate protection using one pre-pack ownership snapshot, a leveled Vending
Machine UI, and a policy-gated Developer Product mall for Crystal Shards. It must
remove the temporary `crystalShards = 125` login override before paid currency is
enabled. `ArePaidRandomItemsRestricted` hides and hard-disables the Item Mall while
the unpaid, earnable-Shard Vending Machine path remains available. Receipt grants
must be deduplicated and confirmed persisted before returning `PurchaseGranted`.

## Targeting Revamp — Explicit playTarget (PLAN_BATTLE_TARGET.md, 2026-06-25)

All changes from PLAN_BATTLE_TARGET implemented. Schema validation passes with 133 cards and 0 errors.

**Removed:** `CardText.targetClass(card)`, `CardText.canHitFace(card)`, and all call sites in CardData and TargetingSystem.

**Added:** `CardText.playTarget(card)` — returns the card's explicit `playTarget` field for spells or `"empty_slot"` for creatures. CardData re-exports `playTarget`.

**playTarget values and count (50 pack spells + the_coin):**

| Value | Spells |
|---|---|
| `own_hero` | bristleplate, unbroken_guard, mistmend, renew, soul_recovery, moonpool_rite, crystal_vent |
| `own_side` | defiant_roar, clan_memory, clan_rally, den_reserves, hunting_instinct, emerald_rush, pack_tactics, nine_lives, sapphire_waters, grave_call, the_coin |
| `own_board` | bristle_banner, crimson_overrun, predators_assault, eternal_rebirth |
| `enemy_hero` | — (reserved for future cards) |
| `enemy_side` | shadow_smoke |
| `enemy_board` | thunderous_roar, last_stand, greenveil_ambush, memory_shards, spirit_harvest, essence_tide |
| `enemy_creature` | maulers_finish, crush_the_mighty, needle_step, glassfang_seal, apex_hunt, sudden_death, spirit_crush |
| `enemy_character` | vangorn_slam, fleetpaw_strike, twinclaw, sapphire_leech |
| `friendly_creature` | thickpelt_oath, clanhide_rite, vangorn_charge, whisker_reflex, emerald_claws, vanishing_pounce, spirit_touch, moonpool_blessing, spirit_bloom, rebirth_charm, crystal_growth |
| `battle_board` | — (reserved for future cards) |
| `any_creature` | — (reserved for future cards) |
| `friendly_character` | — (reserved for future cards) |

**CardSchema:** `PLAY_TARGETS` set enforced; spells without a valid `playTarget` fail validation; creatures with a `playTarget` field fail validation; spell `playTarget` is validated for compatibility with declared effects.

**TargetingSystem rewrite:**
- `computeDropZones(card)` now drives zones from `playTarget`; zone-drop targets (`own_board`, `enemy_board`, `battle_board`, `own_side`, `enemy_side`) add all relevant slot/hero frames with `kind="zoneDrop"`.
- `applyDragHighlights()` rewritten: zone-drops highlight without dimming (no single chosen target); chosen targets dim invalid slots normally.
- `dragHintText()` returns correct hint per playTarget value.
- `endDrag()` sends `opts.zone = "..."` for zone-drop kinds, chosen-target opts unchanged.

**BattleController (server):**
- `VALID_ZONES` table and `zoneCanonical()` added.
- `validateChosenTarget` now rejects stealthed enemy creatures for targeted spells.
- `validatePlayCard` accepts `opts.zone` for zone-drop spells: validates against `card.playTarget`, rejects mismatches, sets `opts.chosenZone = zoneCanonical(zone, who)`.

**BattleLogic:** `chosenZone = opts.chosenZone` threaded through all three `baseCtx` calls in `playCard` (emerge, playBlock, cast) for future zone-aware action resolution.

## Board-Generated Charge and New Card Actions (PLAN_BATTLE_CHARGE_V2.md, 2026-06-25)

All 8 phases of PLAN_BATTLE_CHARGE_V2 implemented. Post-review fixes on 2026-06-25 aligned invalid Shatter targeting, duplicate hand-tax behavior, NPC Crystal Vent scoring, the disabled-Shatter board marker, and docs/source JSON drift.

**Charge source change:** Normal +1 Charge from playing a MIGHTY/SWIFT/VITAL card is removed. Charge is now generated only by board creatures at end of turn. Each non-NEUTRAL creature on board at end of turn grants +1 Charge of its type to the owning slot (matching → stack; empty slot → create; both slots occupied off-type → skip). Board generation never displaces an occupied slot.

**Four new card actions (Effects/Actions, CardSchema, CardText):**

| Action | Trigger | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `destroy_charge_slot` | cast | Destroys own lowest-amount Charge slot. Requires `two_charge_slots_occupied`. |
| `drain_charge` | cast | Removes N Charge from target player's current (or lowest) slot. Empties slot on zero. |
| `disable_shatter` | cast | Marks an enemy creature with Shatter as `shatterDisabled=true`; its Shatter effects do not fire while marked. Invalid on creatures with no Shatter. Cleared on bounce/death. |
| `add_additional_charge_cost_to_player_hand` | cast | Applies a +N Charge cost increase to matching Charge-cost card copies currently in the target's hand. Uses a remaining-copy count so later same-id draws do not extend the modifier. Selector: `"all"` or `"random"`. |

**New condition:** `two_charge_slots_occupied` — checks whether the specified side has both Charge slots occupied.

**New trigger:** `take_damage` — fires on a creature when it takes non-lethal damage.

**New ChargeState helpers:** `canGainWithoutReplace`, `bothSlotsOccupied`, `destroySlot`, `drainCharge`.

**New Ops helpers:** `destroyChargeSlot`, `drainCharge`, `addChargeCostMod`, `clearChargeCostMod`, `effectiveChargeCost`.

**CardCost (RS):** `canPay`, `getCostParts`, `failureReason` now apply `chargeCostMods` from `side.chargeCostMods` so both NPC and client badge show the effective (hand-taxed) cost.

**BattleRegistry:** `viewFor` now includes `chargeCostMods` in the player side payload.

**BattleUIController / CardVisuals:** `popChargeSocket` has distinct tweens for `board_end_turn` (gentle pulse), `drain` (sharp shrink+recover), and `destroy_slot` (scale-to-zero). `ChargeCostBadge.Value.TextColor3` accepts `chargeCostColor` (STAT_DEBUFF = red when hand-taxed). Hand render loop computes effective charge cost via `clientEffectiveChargeCost` and passes it through `buildCard`. Board cards show a compact red `X` marker when `shatterDisabled=true`.

**NpcAI:** contextual scoring for `destroy_charge_slot` (+6 if the action owner has ≥2 slots, −5 otherwise), `drain_charge` (+4 if enemy has charge, −3 otherwise), `disable_shatter` (+5 if enemy board has a shatter creature, −6 otherwise), `add_additional_charge_cost_to_player_hand` (+3 baseline). Creature scoring adds +2 if creature type stacks an existing slot, +1 otherwise.

**Pack counts:** 132 pack cards total (ruby_bear 40, emerald_cat 40, sapphire_frog 40, stonebark 12). 29 pure-Charge cards (ruby_bear 10, emerald_cat 9, sapphire_frog 10). 3 starters at 30 cards each, no Crystal Vent in starters.

Headless sim: 45 games (15 per matchup, 0 errors). Win rates: mighty vs swift swift wins 15–0 (avg 8 turns); mighty vs vital mighty wins 11–4 (avg 21 turns); swift vs vital swift wins 8–7 (avg 12 turns).

## Charge costs and CORRUPTED trait (PLAN_BATTLE_CHARGE_USAGE.md, 2026-06-23)

Three cost models live: **Energy-only** (unchanged), **Hybrid** (`cost=N` +
`chargeCost={battleType,amount}`), and **Pure-Charge** (`cost=0` +
`chargeCost={battleType,amount}`). Payment is atomic — both resources validated
before either is spent. Charge cost is paid before effect resolution; there is no normal played-card Charge grant in the current V2 rules.

- New `ReplicatedStorage/Modules/CardTraits` — `has(card, trait)` scans effects[] for
  a `passive` trigger entry by action name (e.g. `"corrupted"`).
- New `ReplicatedStorage/Modules/CardCost` — shared server+client helper:
  `getEnergyCost`, `getChargeCost`, `canPay`, `getCostParts`, `failureReason`.
- `CardSchema` extended: `passive` trigger, `corrupted` action, CORRUPTED-needs-passive guard.
- `BattleLogic.playCard` upgraded: `payChargeCost` helper uses reason `"card_cost"`.
  The former `grantNormalCharge` path was removed by PLAN_BATTLE_CHARGE_V2.
- `CardVisuals` extended: `ChargeCostBadge` alongside `CostBadge` (pure-Charge repositions
  to Energy slot, hides `CostBadge`); CORRUPTED name prefix `☠ `; `buildCardFrame` stores
  `EMBLEM_X`/`ENERGY_SIZE`/`ENERGY_Y` as frame attributes for runtime repositioning.
- `BattleUIController` and `InventoryController`: pass `chargeCost` and `corrupted` to
  `updateCardFrame`; hand, hover, mobile, and board previews preserve printed
  Charge costs and CORRUPTED markers; `InventoryController` deck editor shows
  per-type gen/spender/PC counts.
- `CardText`: renders passive `corrupted` as rules text instead of exposing the raw action name.
- `GraveLogPanel`: passes `chargeCost` and `corrupted` in card opts; removed stray
  `CostBadge.Visible` override that was fighting pure-Charge logic.
- `NpcAI`: affordability check upgraded to `CardCost.canPay` — NPC now correctly handles
  hybrid and pure-Charge cards.
- The early fixture cards from this phase were superseded by the PLAN_BATTLE_CHARGE_V2
  pack reconstruction. Current packs contain 29 pure-Charge cards and no current
  content depends on Corrupted.

Verified headless (Phase 1: 34/34, Phase 2+3+4: 21/23 correct assertions + 3/3 fix,
Phase 6 NPC: 4/4, Phase 7 content: 14/14).

## Battle Charge migration (2026-06-23)

The **Crystal Core active skill is fully removed and replaced by the two-slot
Battle Charge system** (`PLAN_BATTLE_CHARGE.md`). Summary of what changed:

- New shared `ReplicatedStorage/Modules/ChargeConfig` (producing types + Battle Type
  palette) and server `ServerScriptService/Modules/ChargeState` (authoritative
  two-slot state machine: gain/spend/normalize/replace + per-change events).
- `BattleLogic.playCard` originally granted **+1 normal Charge** after a
  MIGHTY/SWIFT/VITAL card resolved. PLAN_BATTLE_CHARGE_V2 removed that grant;
  Charge now comes from board end-turn generation and explicit `gain_charge`
  effects. `countCoreCard` and `useCore` remain removed.
- Removed: `coreId`/`coreUsedThisTurn`/`coreCounters`, `BattleLogic.useCore`, the
  `UseCore` server handler (remote left orphaned), NPC `aiUseCore`, and the entire
  client Core surface (preview/drag/targeting/panel). `CrystalCores.lua` is orphaned.
- Snapshots carry `chargeSlots`/`currentChargeSlot`/`chargeSeq`/`chargeEvents`
  (perspective-remapped); hero cards render two Charge sockets with emblem art.
- SaveService schema **v5.0**: intentional major reset for canonical card IDs.
  Profiles below major version 5 are wiped to fresh onboarding data on load,
  preventing retired IDs from surviving in collections or decks.

Verified headless (state machine 39/39, card-play integration, replication 16/16,
SaveService 8/8, 9-game AI sim 0 errors) and in live Studio Play (charge accrues and
renders, deck builder Core-free).

## Module Status

| Module | Location | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Cards (definitions) | `ReplicatedStorage/Definitions/Cards.lua` | ✅ Complete — 132 pack cards across 4 packs + `the_coin` engine card (NEUTRAL spell, cost 0, `gain_energy` 1; not collectible / never in a deck), id-keyed map, effects[] schema |
| Decks (definitions) | `ReplicatedStorage/Definitions/Decks.lua` | ✅ Complete — 3 starter decks normalized to 30 cards each, expanded from deck_starter.json |
| CrystalCores (definitions) | `ReplicatedStorage/Definitions/CrystalCores.lua` | ⚪ Orphaned — Crystal Core active skills removed (Battle Charge migration). Module still exists but nothing requires it; kept as a migration artifact. |
| ChargeConfig (definitions) | `ReplicatedStorage/Modules/ChargeConfig.lua` | ✅ Complete — shared single source of truth: Charge-producing types (`MIGHTY`/`SWIFT`/`VITAL`; NEUTRAL excluded), `isProducing()`, `MAX_SLOTS=2`, `ChargeEmblems`-adjacent `Colors` palette (also consumed by `CardVisuals.TC_type`) |
| ChargeState (engine) | `ServerScriptService/Modules/ChargeState.lua` | ✅ Complete — authoritative two-slot Charge state machine: `init`, `normalizeSlots`, `gainCharge`, `canSpendCharge`, `spendCharge`, `gainChargesOrdered`, `drainEvents`, `canGainWithoutReplace`, `bothSlotsOccupied`, `destroySlot`, `drainCharge`. Charge source is now board end-turn only; board generation uses `canGainWithoutReplace` to never displace an occupied off-type slot. |
| CardSchema | `ReplicatedStorage/Modules/CardSchema.lua` | ✅ Complete — validates required fields, trigger/action/target/condition/playTarget vocabs (incl. `passive` trigger + `corrupted` action + CORRUPTED-needs-passive guard + `take_damage` trigger + 4 new actions: `destroy_charge_slot`, `drain_charge`, `disable_shatter`, `add_additional_charge_cost_to_player_hand`), spell playTarget/effect compatibility, condition `two_charge_slots_occupied`, chargeCost fields, deck id resolution |
| CardTraits | `ReplicatedStorage/Modules/CardTraits.lua` | ✅ Complete — `has(card, trait)` scans effects[] for a `{trigger="passive", action=trait}` entry; nil-safe |
| CardCost | `ReplicatedStorage/Modules/CardCost.lua` | ✅ Complete — shared server+client cost helper: `getEnergyCost` (respects cost mods), `getChargeCost`, `canPay` (atomic: energy + effective charge), `getCostParts`, `failureReason`; handles all 3 cost models; applies `side.chargeCostMods` via local `effectiveChargeCost` helper so hand-taxed charge costs are reflected in affordability, badge display, and NPC decisions |
| CardText | `ReplicatedStorage/Modules/CardText.lua` | ✅ Complete — `getAbilityDisplay(cardId)` renders effects[] as (label, body), spell-level conditions shown as an *If …,* / *Chain:* prefix; passive `corrupted` renders as its Battle Charge rule text; `playTarget(card)` returns explicit spell playTarget or `"empty_slot"` for creatures |
| CardData (shim) | `ReplicatedStorage/Modules/CardData.lua` | ✅ Complete — thin shim the client requires; re-exposes `Cards` plus CardText's `getAbilityDisplay`/`playTarget` under the legacy `CardData` name |
| Effects/Util | `ServerScriptService/Modules/Effects/Util.lua` | ✅ Complete — BOARD_SIZE=3, `opp`, `getCreature`, `creatureTargets`, `attackOf`, `valueOf` (value/valueFrom) |
| Effects/Conditions | `ServerScriptService/Modules/Effects/Conditions.lua` | ✅ Complete — 7 condition types: `damaged`, `target_undamaged`, `attack_gte`, `attack_lte`, `friendly_damaged_exists`, `chain`, `two_charge_slots_occupied` |
| Effects/Targeting | `ServerScriptService/Modules/Effects/Targeting.lua` | ✅ Complete — resolves all target/area combos; chosen targets are descriptor-validated before use and illegal picks fall back only to legal server targets |
| Effects/Actions | `ServerScriptService/Modules/Effects/Actions.lua` | ✅ Complete — 16+ handlers: damage (single/all/split/lifesteal/valueFrom), heal, gain_armor, buff, draw_card (+filter), destroy, grant_keyword, summon, bounce, return_from_graveyard, reduce_cost, set_cost, gain_energy, gain_charge; plus 4 new: `destroy_charge_slot`, `drain_charge`, `disable_shatter`, `add_additional_charge_cost_to_player_hand` |
| Effects/Triggers | `ServerScriptService/Modules/Effects/Triggers.lua` | ✅ Complete — `fireEvent(state, event, base)`; `chain` fires on emerge/cast when `cardsPlayedThisTurn >= 2`; `base.dynamic` shared across entries of one card; `playBlock(base, card)` pre-play check rejects a spell when no effect would resolve (unmet condition / no valid target / action-specific invalid target such as `disable_shatter` on a non-Shatter creature) |
| Effects/Ops | `ServerScriptService/Modules/Effects/Ops.lua` | ✅ Complete — game-op mutation layer (healHero, healCreature, gainArmor, damageHero, damageCreature+`take_damage` event, killCreature+rebirth+`shatterDisabled` guard, buffCreature, drawCard+filter, bounce+`shatterDisabled` clear, summon, returnFromGraveyard, keyword helpers, cost system, gainEnergy, newInstance, destroyChargeSlot, drainCharge, addChargeCostMod with remaining-copy counts, clearChargeCostMod, effectiveChargeCost) |
| BattleLogic | `ServerScriptService/Modules/BattleLogic.lua` | ✅ Complete (effects[] engine + Board-Generated Charge V2) — `newSide`/`newBattle` initializes two-slot Charge state + `chargeCostMods={}`; `playCard` atomically validates/pays Energy + effective charge (`Ops.effectiveChargeCost`), clears `chargeCostMods` entry on play, threads `chosenZone` through emerge/playBlock/cast contexts, resolves emerge/cast — no normal +1 grant; `endTurn` iterates owner board and calls `ChargeState.gainCharge` for each non-NEUTRAL creature where `canGainWithoutReplace` is true (reason `"board_end_turn"`); `attack` fires `deal_damage` event. |
| NpcAI | `ServerScriptService/Modules/NpcAI.lua` | ✅ Complete (effects[] scoring, V2 action scoring, board-presence Charge bonus) — `takeTurn(state, Logic, who)`; `scoreCard` by action verb including contextual scoring for `destroy_charge_slot`, `drain_charge`, `disable_shatter`, `add_additional_charge_cost_to_player_hand`; creature scoring includes +1/+2 bonus for non-NEUTRAL types (board end-turn Charge generation); affordability uses `CardCost.canPay` with effective charge cost; `aiAttack` prefers lethal/clean kills and handles Taunt. |
| BattleController | `ServerScriptService/BattleController.lua` | ✅ Complete (v5) — thin remote-wiring; battle records in `BattleRegistry`, turn loop in `DuelSession`, tables/seating in `TableManager`. `startPvE`/`startPvP` read active deck cards from `SaveService.getActiveBattleDeck`; Noob TalkPrompt wired; battle remotes derive seat/battle server-side, rate-limit lightly, validate `PlayCard`/`DeclareAttack`, validate chosen targets and `opts.zone` against `playTarget`, reject targeted enemy Stealth, leave `UseCore` orphaned/unwired, cancel session timers on battle end, delegate rewards to `RewardService`; PvE persists via `SaveService.applyRewards` (present winners), PvP flags `beginPvpMatch` at start + records `recordPvpResult` at end (W/L, anti rage-quit); calls `SaveService.init()` at boot |
| BattleRegistry | `ServerScriptService/Modules/BattleRegistry.lua` | ✅ Complete — `Battles[battleId]`, `PlayerBattle[userId]` reverse index, `spectators` set; `viewFor`/`viewForSpectator` perspective relabel (own seat→`player`), `remapOpts`; clients never send battleId; state views include Battle Charge fields (`chargeSlots`, `currentChargeSlot`, `chargeSeq`, `chargeEvents`, `chargeCostMods`) and server timer metadata |
| DuelSession | `ServerScriptService/Modules/DuelSession.lua` | ✅ Complete — per-battle turn loop: `start`, `afterHumanAction`, `humanEndTurn`, internal `runNpcTurn`; token-guarded human turn timers with `TURN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` and `MAX_TIMEOUTS_BEFORE_FORFEIT`; timeout auto-end and repeated-timeout auto-forfeit |
| RewardService | `ServerScriptService/Modules/RewardService.lua` | ✅ Complete (policy only) — builds mode-aware reward payloads without persistence: PvE winner EXP/gold/NPC-deck card drop; PvE loser/npc no payload; PVP winner/loser placeholder messages for Phase 4 persistence |
| TableManager | `ServerScriptService/Modules/TableManager.lua` | ✅ Complete — FREE/RESERVED/OCCUPIED tables; one table `ProximityPrompt` ("Sit"/disabled, no Stand Up); **chained `awaitSeated` seating, no HRP anchoring** (SeatWeld positions, jump-state+controls block eject); `spawnNpcAt` clones Noob to chair 2 for PvE; `handleTalkToNpc`/`handleReadyUp`/`handleStandUp`. **Seating reliability (2026-06-22):** `seatPlayerAt` now clears stale seat/lock state before re-seating, **respects `awaitSeated`** (3s window + one retry), and on failure releases the reservation and returns false — a battle can never start with the player unseated ("in place"). `handleTalkToNpc` no longer returns silently: when no table is free or seating fails it fires `BattleUnseated` (clears the optimistic "Finding Table" overlay) and `Notify` with a reason. BattleUI records the active Seat CFrame and, after the SeatWeld releases, performs the final client-owned 3.5-stud side placement on `BattleUnseated`/`BattleOver`. |
| ProfileStore | `ServerScriptService/Packages/ProfileStore.lua` | ✅ Vendored (loleris/MAD STUDIO, pinned commit `45c9847`) — session-locked DataStore lib; provenance/raw copy in repo `vendor/`. `DataStoreState="Access"` confirmed in this published place |
| SaveService | `ServerScriptService/Modules/SaveService.lua` | ✅ Complete (Phase 4 + canonical-ID reset) — ProfileStore wrapper. Schema **v5.0** `{_version, archetype, collection, decks, activeDeckId, crystalShards, crystalDust, exp, level, pvp, activeMatch, quests}`; every older profile is reset so retired card IDs cannot survive. `applyCardPackPurchase` delegates one validated atomic mutation to `GachaTransaction`, marks the profile dirty, and schedules immediate persistence. Decks are Core-free; validates known + owned cards, max 2 copies, exact 30 for active decks, and 12-deck cap. |
| GachaConfig | `ReplicatedStorage/Modules/GachaConfig.lua` | ✅ Complete — shared 50-Shard cost, five-card count, 70/25/5 weights, 5/20/80 duplicate Dust, 8-stud prompt range, server tolerance, and cooldown. |
| GachaTransaction | `ServerScriptService/Modules/GachaTransaction.lua` | ✅ Complete — pure validate-first transaction; enforces the two-copy cap across existing and pending same-pack copies, converts later copies to Dust, and commits shards/cards/Dust together. |
| GachaService | `ServerScriptService/Modules/GachaService.lua` | ✅ Complete — builds the unified 132-card collectible pool (excludes `the_coin`), generates weighted five-card rolls, and delegates persistence to SaveService. Exposes deterministic generation and pool summary for tests. |
| GachaController | `ServerScriptService/GachaController.lua` | ✅ Complete — owns `OpenCardPack`; validates proximity to the named vending anchor, throttles requests, serializes one roll per player, and uses `xpcall` cleanup so failures cannot strand the lock. |
| VendingMachineController | `StarterPlayer/StarterPlayerScripts/VendingMachineController.lua` | ✅ Complete — direct named prompt binding, fresh `GetQuestSnapshot` balance on open, authoritative response balances, protected RemoteFunction invocation, visible pack tear, pre-colored card stack, correct ability lookup, five-card reveal, Dust result, and reusable Continue lifecycle. |
| GachaAcquisitionSpec | `TestService/GachaAcquisitionSpec.lua` | ✅ Passing — verifies pool=132, five-card generation, same-pack cap/Dust behavior, insufficient-funds atomicity, and invalid-roll atomicity. |
| CardVisuals | `StarterGui/BattleUI/Modules/CardVisuals` | ✅ Complete — emblems LEFT edge; `ChargeCostBadge` alongside `CostBadge`; `updateCardFrame` accepts `chargeCost`, `chargeCostColor` (STAT_DEBUFF when hand-taxed), `corrupted`, and board `status.shatterDisabled` opts; pure-Charge hides `CostBadge` and repositions `ChargeCostBadge` to Energy slot; disabled Shatter renders as a compact red `X` badge; CORRUPTED prefix `☠ ` in NameBar |
| BattleUIController | `StarterGui/BattleUI/BattleUIController` | ✅ Complete — `buildCard` accepts `effChargeCost` and passes effective `chargeCost`/`chargeCostColor` to `updateCardFrame`; board render passes `shatterDisabled` status; hand render loop computes effective charge cost via `clientEffectiveChargeCost(state.player.chargeCostMods, ...)`; mobile hand dragging mirrors `CardData.playTarget(card)` zones and sends `opts.zone` for zone drops; `popChargeSocket` has distinct tweens for `board_end_turn` (gentle pulse), `drain` (sharp shrink), `destroy_slot` (scale-to-zero), `spend` (shrink), and other gains (pop). |
| TargetingSystem | `StarterGui/BattleUI/Modules/TargetingSystem` | ✅ Complete — `computeDropZones` driven by `CardData.playTarget(card)` across single targets and zone drops; `endDrag` sends `{slot=idx}`, `{target={side,slot}}`, or `{zone="..."}`; targeted enemy creatures with Stealth are excluded client-side |
| GraveLogPanel | `StarterGui/BattleUI/Modules/GraveLogPanel` | ✅ Complete — uses `creature`/`spell` types; passes `race`, `chargeCost`, and `corrupted` to card opts; stray `CostBadge.Visible=true` override removed (was fighting pure-Charge badge logic) |
| CardPreviewController | `StarterGui/BattleUI/Modules/CardPreviewController` | ✅ Complete — preview layer at ZIndex 50; `show(frame, opts, side)` supports above/left (auto-flips right near screen edge) |
| UXMode | `StarterGui/BattleUI/Modules/UXMode` | ✅ Complete — Desktop/Mobile toggle driven by viewport width (<800px=Mobile) and LastInputType |
| InventoryService | `ServerScriptService/InventoryService` | ✅ Complete (Phase 5) — `GetInventory` RemoteFunction handler; returns the player's `collection` (cardId multiset) from `SaveService`; empty for no/inactive profile |
| DeckService | `ServerScriptService/DeckService` | ✅ Complete — RemoteFunction wrapper for `GetDecks`, `CreateDeck`, `SaveDeckCards`, `RenameDeck`, `DeleteDeck`, and `SetActiveDeck`; responses use `{ok=true,data=...}` or `{ok=false,error=...}` |
| Hud + HudController | `StarterGui/Hud` (+ `HudController`) | ✅ Complete — `TopRightAnchor` frame (horizontal UIListLayout) hosting world icons; `InventoryButton` now opens **Card Library**. `HudController` shows the anchor in free-roam, hides the whole group on `BattleLoading`/`BattleSeated`/`UpdateBattleState`, restores on `BattleOver`/`BattleUnseated`/respawn |
| InventoryUI + InventoryController | `StarterGui/InventoryUI` (+ `InventoryController`) | ✅ Complete — Card Library page stack. Card grid passes `chargeCost` and `corrupted` to `updateCardFrame`. Deck editor shows non-blocking `>2 Charge Types` warning plus per-type generator/spender (`MIG:+N/-N`) and pure-Charge count (`PC:N`) summary beneath the type indicator. |
| AssetIds | `ReplicatedStorage/Modules/AssetIds` | ✅ Complete — image SSOT with a small `startupList()`, exact-five `revealList(cards)`, and full-library `criticalList()` retained for audits. CardVisuals consumes the same IDs. |
| AssetPreloader | `ReplicatedStorage/Modules/AssetPreloader` | ✅ Complete — requires dense arrays, passes literal arrays to `PreloadAsync`, uses the documented callback plus successful `GetAssetFetchStatus`, and retries/times out each ID independently with bounded concurrency and failure reporting. |
| LoadingScreen | `ReplicatedFirst/LoadingScreen` | ✅ Complete — zero-remote-asset functional UI; gates only immediately needed shared images. The decorative background is non-blocking, Workspace/Lighting is not bulk preloaded, and exact rolled card art is gated by PackRevealController before the 3D stage. |
| NpcSit | `ServerScriptService/NpcSit` | ⚪ Retired (Disabled) — superseded by TableManager |
| ChairInteraction | `StarterPlayer/StarterPlayerScripts/ChairInteraction` | ⚪ Retired (removed/missing in current place) — superseded by TableManager |

**The game is playable for manual testing.** All modules implement the current ruleset (universal Energy, 3-slot board, direct face attacks, effects[] abilities, quickstrike/lifesteal/rebirth keywords, two-slot Battle Charge). Player starts with an active `Mighty Starter` deck; PvE Noob randomizes among the three starter decks.

---

## Card Definitions — Detail

- **132 unique pack cards** across 4 packs: ruby_bear (40 MIGHTY, 24 creatures / 16 spells, 10 pure-Charge), emerald_cat (40 SWIFT, 24 creatures / 16 spells, 9 pure-Charge), sapphire_frog (40 VITAL, 24 creatures / 16 spells, 10 pure-Charge), stonebark (12 NEUTRAL — 5 Treants, 5 Golems, Crystal Vent, Crystal Growth); plus `the_coin` engine card (not collectible). 29 pure-Charge cards total.
- Notable new cards using the four new actions:
  - `crystal_vent` (NEUTRAL spell, cost=2 Energy) — `destroy_charge_slot` (self, lowest) gated on `two_charge_slots_occupied`
  - `spirit_crush` (VITAL spell) — `drain_charge` (enemy current, 1)
  - `glassfang_seal` (SWIFT spell) — `disable_shatter` (enemy creature)
  - `shadow_smoke` (SWIFT spell) — `add_additional_charge_cost_to_player_hand` (enemy, all, +1)
  - Cards with `take_damage` trigger: `rumbleclaw`, `scarback` (MIGHTY), `amber_golem` (NEUTRAL)
- **3 starter decks** from deck_starter.json: mighty (30), swift (30), vital (30)
- **CrystalCores module remains orphaned**: 3 pure and 3 dual-type legacy Cores still exist in `ReplicatedStorage/Definitions/CrystalCores.lua` as a migration artifact, but no live code requires them.
- No Invoker; no old 32-card CardData
- All cards have `image_prompt` fields for AI art generation
- the_coin engine card: cost 0, `{trigger="cast", action="gain_energy", value=1}` — dealt to the second player in `DuelSession.start`; expires end of turn 2 if unused (`BattleLogic.endTurn`)

---

## BattleLogic — Detail

Effects[] engine implementing:
- Universal Energy ramp 0→10, Coin, Fatigue. Hero damage, including fatigue overkill, clamps HP at 0 so the UI never displays negative Core HP
- `playCard` — uses `Ops.effectiveChargeCost` + `Ops.effectiveCost` for cost mods; creature summons (slot required); spell casts; fires `emerge`/`cast` via Triggers bus; tallies `cardsPlayedThisTurn`; decrements affected `chargeCostMods` remaining-copy counts when a taxed card is played. Spells are gated by `Triggers.playBlock` first. No normal +1 Charge grant.
- `attack` — Hearthstone-style simultaneous combat; Taunt/Stealth gating; `quickstrike`; `lifesteal`; fires `deal_damage` event after resolution
- `startTurn` / `endTurn` — energy ramp, `clearTurnCostMods`, reset `attackedThisTurn`/`summonedThisTurn`; turn_end event fires; board end-turn Charge generation loop after turn_end effects; Coin expires on turn 2
- **Keywords:** `taunt`, `charge`, `stealth`, `quickstrike` (first-strike), `lifesteal` (heal source hero for damage dealt), `rebirth` (resummon full stats once; Shatter fires on the triggering death before rebirth)
- **Cost system:** `addCostMod`/`effectiveCost`/`clearTurnCostMods` over `hand`/`drawn_cards`/`returned_card` pools with `this_turn` duration
- No Invoker, no discounts, no combo_extra_attack

## NpcAI — Detail

- **`takeTurn(state, Logic, who)`** — `who` defaults to "npc"
- **Phase 1 — card play:** scores all affordable plays via `scoreCard(state, who, opp, card)` by action verb; `noisyPick` with jitter; loops until nothing scores above threshold. New action scoring: `destroy_charge_slot` (+6 if the action's charge owner has ≥2 slots, −5 otherwise), `drain_charge` (+4 if enemy has charge, −3), `disable_shatter` (+5 if enemy board has shatter creature, −6), `add_additional_charge_cost_to_player_hand` (+3 baseline). Creature scoring: non-NEUTRAL type bonus +2 if stacks existing slot, +1 otherwise (board end-turn Charge generation value).
- **Phase 2 — attack:** `aiAttack` prefers clean kills → lethal → even trade → safe poke → face; handles Taunt gating
- No Invoker scoring; does not deliberately sequence for Chain

## RemoteEvents

| Event | Direction | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| `StartDuel` | Client → Server | — (orphaned; no handler in BattleController v5) |
| `PlayCard` | Client → Server | `cardId, opts` where `opts = {slot=N}` (creature), `opts = {target={side,slot}}` (single-target spell; `slot=0` = hero), or `opts = {zone="own_board"|"enemy_board"|"battle_board"|"own_side"|"enemy_side"}` (zone-drop spell) |
| `DeclareAttack` | Client → Server | `attackerSlot, targetSlot` |
| `EndTurn` | Client → Server | — |
| `Forfeit` | Client → Server | — |
| `StandUp` | Client → Server | — (stand from a seat; also auto-stand on disconnect) |
| `ReadyUp` | Client → Server | — (PVP ready handshake) |
| `UseCore` | Client → Server | **Orphaned** (Battle Charge migration) — no server handler; firing it does nothing. Kept as a migration artifact like `StartDuel`/`UseSkill` |
| `UpdateBattleState` | Server → Client | sanitized, perspective-relabelled state snapshot (densified board arrays); player snapshot carries `costMods` (client effective-cost coloring); timer metadata = `serverNow`, `turnStartedAt`, `turnEndsAt`, `turnDuration`, `timeoutStreaks`; `warnings` = transient rejection reasons (energy/taunt/prerequisite/timeout), cleared after each broadcast |
| `BattleOver` | Server → Client | `{ winner, rewards }`. PvE rewards = EXP/gold/card-drop (persisted via SaveService). PvP rewards `.message` = "Victory!/Defeat. Record: XW/YL" (W/L persisted via SaveService) |
| `BattleSeated` | Server → Client | `tableId, chairIdx` — PVP pre-battle seat; shows SeatedOverlay |
| `BattleUnseated` | Server → Client | — hides SeatedOverlay/loading, unlocks controls, restores local table prompts after stand-up or aborted seating |
| `BattleLoading` | Server → Client | — shows input-blocking PvE "Finding Table..." overlay; clears on battle state, unseat, battle over, timeout, or respawn |
| `Notify` | Server → Client | `message` — free-roam toast (own `NotifyOverlay` ScreenGui, shows even when BattleUI is disabled). Used by `handleTalkToNpc` for "all tables busy" / "couldn't seat you" |
| `GetInventory` | Client → Server (RemoteFunction) | invoke → returns the player's `collection` (cardId multiset) from `SaveService`; empty list if no active profile |
| `GetDecks` / `CreateDeck` / `SaveDeckCards` / `RenameDeck` / `DeleteDeck` / `SetActiveDeck` | Client → Server (RemoteFunction) | invoke → server-validated deck management responses |

## Persistence

**ProfileStore-backed persistence is live (PLAN_BACKEND Phase 4).** `SaveService`
(`SSS/Modules/SaveService`) wraps the vendored ProfileStore (`SSS/Packages/ProfileStore`,
pinned commit `45c9847`).

- **Store:** `"PlayerProfiles"`, key `Player_<UserId>`. Schema **v5.0** (canonical card-ID reset):
  `{_version={major,minor}, archetype, collection, decks, activeDeckId,
  crystalShards, crystalDust, exp, level, pvp, activeMatch, quests}`. Profiles below major version 5 run
  `major_reset` and receive fresh onboarding data using canonical card IDs.
- **Temporary test economy override:** every successful profile login sets
  `crystalShards = 125` before the initial client snapshot. Pack spending still
  persists normally during the session; the next login restores 125.
- **Lifecycle:** PlayerAdded → `StartSessionAsync` (session lock, `Cancel` on leave) →
  `migrate` (before `Reconcile`) → `Reconcile`. PlayerRemoving → `EndSession`.
  `OnSessionEnd` kicks on remote session steal. Connect-first + `Loading` guard.
- **New-player grant:** the v5 template starts empty and quest-gated; choosing an
  archetype grants its 30-card starter collection and active starter deck.
- **Autosave:** dirty-flag 60s pooled `Profile:Save()`; ProfileStore `AUTO_SAVE_PERIOD`
  (~300s) backstop; card drops and successful pack purchases schedule an immediate save.
- **Pack purchase:** `GachaTransaction` validates the entire roll before mutation,
  updates Shards/cards/Dust atomically, and returns authoritative balances. Same-pack
  repeats participate in the two-copy cap.
- **Migration:** `migrate(data)` — minor (`MINOR_MIGRATIONS` table) / major (guarded
  hard reset to starter, `ALLOW_MAJOR_RESET`) / ahead (served as-is).
- **PvE rewards:** `BattleController.endBattle` → `SaveService.applyRewards` for present
  human winners (EXP/Crystal Shards/card drop).
- **PvP W/L + anti rage-quit (v1.1):** `startPvP` → `SaveService.beginPvpMatch` flags both
  players `activeMatch` and **force-saves** it. `endBattle` → `recordPvpResult(player, won)`
  records `pvp.wins/losses` + clears the flag for present players (returns the running
  record, shown as `BattleOver` message "Victory!/Defeat. Record: XW/YL"). A player who
  disconnects mid-match keeps the flag (saved at start); on their **next login**
  `onPlayerAdded` sees it and records a loss + clears it. Exactly one loss either path
  (present→recorded now/flag cleared; absent→flag resolves on load). Survives rage-quit,
  crash, server crash.
- **Verified 2026-06-21:** live load + starter grant, real-DataStore reward persistence
  across a rejoin, hard-reset, and (headless) migration branches + session double-load guard.

> Verifying a running server's module state from MCP `execute_luau` does **not** work:
> it runs in an isolated plugin VM (separate `require` cache and `_G`). Use in-script
> `print` + `get_console_output` for live checks; `execute_luau` is for self-contained
> headless tests only.

## Known Issues

| Issue | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Card art missing for most cards | 🔴 High | All cards have `image_prompt` fields; art not yet generated/wired. Placeholder `rbxassetid://115543591799677` used for creatures; `rbxassetid://127780045941863` for spell circles |
| Balance: VITAL too weak, MIGHTY too strong | 🔴 High | Headless sim (n=40/matchup, symmetric NpcAI): MIGHTY 71%, SWIFT 55%, VITAL 24%. MIGHTY vs VITAL 35–5. Naive AI doesn't pilot sustain/Lifesteal. Needs card tuning + smarter AI |
| Full PVP Local Server smoke still needed | 🟡 Medium | Phase 3 implementation has single-client Play smoke and isolated timer simulation coverage. Still run Studio Local Server with 2 players: sit/ready/start, independent views, timer resync across mobile/desktop switches, invalid remote probes, forfeit/disconnect cleanup. |
| Archived/unauthorized SOUND assets | 🟡 Medium | Studio play console spams `Failed to load sound rbxassetid://1914538756: Requested asset is archived` and `asset id 150463355 … User is not authorized` (also `150463355`). These are **sound** assets (out of scope of the image preloader); likely from the environment template / a UI sound. Find the referencing instances and replace with owned, non-archived sounds. |
| World/decor textures are not explicitly pre-warmed | 🟢 Low | Roblox streams Workspace/Lighting assets normally. Bulk preloading them previously competed with the essential image gate; startup and exact-five reveal images are the explicit preload scope. |
| Legacy remotes intentionally orphaned | 🟢 Low | `StartDuel`, `UseSkill`, and `UsePlayerSkill` still exist in Remotes with no live server handler in BattleController v5. Kept as migration artifacts for now; deletion deferred to a later cleanup. |
| Stray empty image (`rbxassetid://0`) | 🟢 Low | One `ImageLabel`/`Decal` has `Image=""`/`rbxassetid://0` (surfaced during the asset audit). Harmless; clean up the leftover. |
| Avatar thumbnails in info widgets | 🟢 Low | Main hero portrait uses `GetUserThumbnailAsync`; check remaining placeholder widgets before closing this. |
| NPC foot orientation | 🟢 Low | Z-axis rotation fix pending |
